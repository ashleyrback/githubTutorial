A collaborative tutorial for git and GitHub

Some general comments
---------------------

This tutorial aims to (as much as possible) to dive straight in to topics,
demonstrating with examples, then explaining what is going on after. It assumes
you are a complete novice with git/GitHub, so feel free to skip on ahead
whenever you know what you are doing.

The tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of using a terminal
application to navigate through directories and enter basic commands. We also
recommend having a GitHub account before starting this tutorial - you can
sign up for one [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

Get started!
------------

Different people learn in different ways, that is why we aim to provide a
self-consistent tutorial in three different formats:

-   **Jupyter notebooks** - This collection of
    [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) is the most interactive way to use
    this tutorial. The notebooks contain live (executable) code blocks, in
    amongst narrative text and graphics to guide you through. Jupyter notebooks
    take a little getting used to, but are well worth the effort!
-   **Web pages** - A collection of Markdown-formatted web pages. These are
    static web pages with the same code blocks and narrative information as the
    Jupyter notebooks, the sole difference is that the lack of interactivity.
    You can still copy and paste the code blocks into a terminal but you cannot
    run them directly from the document.
-   **PDF document** - Some people prefer to read through a document, like a
    manual. We have converted the Jupyter notebooks into a LaTex formatted PDF
    that you can download and read at your leisure!

Make it better!
---------------

The cool thing about GitHub is that it's all about collaboration! This
tutorial is a full GitHub repository and uses itself as the source for
interactive examples. This ensures the sustainability of the tutorial!

When you have finished, why not use your new git/GitHub mastery and submit a
pull request to improve this tutorial. Some examples include:

-   Correct a typo, formatting mistake or broken link, if you find one
-   Add another example to help explain something
-   Extend the tutorial to cover some more advanced git commands
-   Do you know any cool hacks/tricks?

Even if you don't want to make a full commit, we always appreciate constructive
feedback. Why not create an issue with your suggested improvement.

Disclaimer
----------

There are plenty of other great git/GitHub tutorials out there and we will
attempt to reference or include any other tutorials that we have personally
found a useful tool for mastering git.

This tutorial came about when a neutrino physics post-doc was often getting
asked questions about how to use git/GitHub, and needed something he could point
student to that could answer their questions. Hopefully, you have found it a
useful resource too!
